So, he made an announcement that he was looking for the right husband for her. Many princes came from faraway lands, but none of them was a good match for the princess.</p>\n<p>Son Tinh was the Spirit of the Mountain, and Thuy Tinh was the Spirit of the Waters. One day, they both appeared as young noblemen and asked to marry the princess. They were equally talented, powerful, and respected. The King found it hard to choose, so he decided to give them a test. He said that the one who brought the proper wedding gifts first the next morning would marry his daughter.</p>\n<p>The next day, Son Tinh arrived early with his gifts. The King kept his promise and gave the princess to him. Thuy Tinh was angry about losing. He challenged Son Tinh to fight for the princess. But Son Tinh refused, believing he had already won fairly. Furious, Thuy Tinh used his power to call the rivers and streams to rise. Soon, the land was covered with floods that destroyed crops and homes.</p>\n<p>Son Tinh stayed calm in his mountain palace. Whenever the water rose, he made his mountains higher. After many days of fighting, Thuy Tinh grew tired and ordered the waters to retreat. Still, he never accepted his defeat. Every year, he tried again to attack, and this is how monsoons came to Vietnam.</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped table-hover\">\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 150px;\">No Soal</th>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Kompetensi</th>\n<td>Pemahaman Inferensial: mampu menarik kesimpulan berdasarkan informasi tersirat dalam teks, pengalaman pribadi, serta intuisi untuk memahami isi teks. </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Sub Kompetensi</th>\n<td>Menyimpulkan pesan moral yang tidak secara eksplisit dinyatakan dalam teks. </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Bentuk Soal</th>\n<td>PGK MCMA</td>\n</tr>\n<!-- kunci -->\n<tr>\n<th>Kunci</th>\n<td>A, B</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\"><p>What is the main lesson of the story?</p>\n<p>There is more than one correct answer.

While many come for the beaches and temples, the island also offers natural attractions that amaze nature lovers from around the world. From national parks and waterfalls to terraced rice fields, Bali is full of natural beauty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the west lies West Bali National Park, a peaceful area filled with green forests, calm mangrove swamps, and colorful coral reefs along the sea. The air is fresh, and the scenery feels untouched. One of the park’s most special sights is the Bali Starling—a rare white bird with bright blue around its eyes. Its soft song adds magic to the quiet forest. Visitors can walk along clear paths and enjoy the rich variety of plants and animals in this protected area.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heading north, travelers find the scenic Munduk Waterfall, surrounded by green hills and forests. Water flows gently over rocky cliffs into a cool clear pool. Mist rises into the air, mixing with the calming sound of falling water. The walk to the waterfall passes through narrow paths lined with coffee and clove trees. Their fresh scent fills the air, offering a pleasant and peaceful experience. Munduk is the perfect place to relax and enjoy Bali’s natural charm.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Near the cultural center Ubud, the famous Tegalalang rice terraces stretch across the hills in green steps. These terraces are shaped by generations of farmers who work the land by hand. In the morning, mist rises above the fields, and sunlight reflects off the water in the paddies. Farmers in wide-brimmed hats plant rice carefully, their feet sinking into the soft earth. Water flows gently through small canals, keeping the fields healthy and green. The quiet surroundings and slow rhythm of farm life create a peaceful and inspiring scene.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These natural wonders highlight Bali's dedication in preserving its environmental and cultural treasures. By exploring these sites, tourists not only experience the island's scenic beauty but also support ongoing conservation efforts, helping to ensure that Bali's wonders last for future generations.</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped table-hover\">\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 150px;\">No Soal</th>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Kompetensi</th>\n<td>Evaluasi dan Apresiasi: mampu membuat penilaian terhadap ide, menanggapi teks secara emosional dan estetis dengan mempertimbangkan dampaknya terhadap perasaan, imajinasi, serta penggunaan bahasa oleh </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Sub Kompetensi</th>\n<td>Mampu  menentukan  bagian  teks  yang paling    sesuai    untuk    menggambarkan karakter utama atau aspek lain dari bacaan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Bentuk Soal</th>\n<td>PGK MCMA</td>\n</tr>\n<!-- kunci -->\n<tr>\n<th>Kunci</th>\n<td>Pernyataan 1, Pernyataan 3, dan Pernyataan 4</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\"><p>Which parts of the text best support the description of Bali as a \"Bali is full of natural beauty\"?</p>\n<p>There is more than one correct answer.

It was my first time working in a professional sports environment, and I was both nervous and excited. The internship went through a few phases, starting from orientation until finally jumping in to help during practices and games.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On my first day, I met the head coach, who welcomed me and explained my tasks. I had to set up cones for drills, bring water for the players, and check the training schedules. The first few days were challenging because I was not used to the morning routine. Every morning I had to wake up early, arrive on time, and follow instructions carefully. I worried about making mistakes, but the coaches were kind and guided me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the second month of my internship, I was trained to handle emergency situations. I got the chance to put that knowledge into practice when something unexpected happened. During football practice, a player fell and hurt his ankle. Everyone stopped, and I quickly ran to get the first aid kit. I helped the coach assess the injury and ensured the player stayed calm while we got him seated safely. Luckily, it wasn’t serious, but the experience reinforced an important lesson: staying alert and prepared during emergencies can make a big difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the end of my internship, the coaches held an evaluation and reflection session where they shared the results of their feedback. They highlighted my strengths in teamwork, responsibility, and communication, and even gave me a club T-shirt as a gift. I felt proud because I had improved in these areas. It was a great experience, and</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I hope to work in a sports club again in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped table-hover\">\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 150px;\">No Soal</th>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Kompetensi</th>\n<td>Pemahaman  Inferensial: mampu  menarik kesimpulan berdasarkan informasi tersirat dalam teks, pengalaman pribadi, serta intuisi untuk memahami isi teks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Sub Kompetensi</th>\n<td>Mampu  menyimpulkan sifat  atau kepribadian  tokoh  berdasarkan  petunjuk eksplisit dalam teks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Bentuk Soal</th>\n<td>PGK MCMA</td>\n</tr>\n<!-- kunci -->\n<tr>\n<th>Kunci</th>\n<td>Pernyataan 1, Pernyataan 3, dan Pernyataan 4 </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</p>\n<p class=\"card-text\"><p>What are the best words to describe the writer’s personality during the internship?</p>\n<p>There is more than one correct answer.
