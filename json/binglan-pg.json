    "bacaan_soal": "<p>AI is increasingly used in various areas of life, including the workplace. While some support this development, others express concern. Below are arguments for and against the use of AI at work.</p> <p>Supporters present three main points. First, efficiency and productivity. AI can handle repetitive, monotonous tasks without fatigue, allowing employees to focus on more complex and creative work. This increases output and saves time. Second, better decision- making. AI can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, identifying patterns and trends that help managers make informed, data-driven decisions. This leads to more accurate forecasts, improved employee engagement, and better overall results. Third, learning and development. AI can enhance employee engagement by offering personalized training. AI systems can detect skill gaps and recommend tailored programs, helping employees grow. This benefits both workers—by boosting confidence and capability—and companies—by fostering more skilled, loyal, and satisfied staff.</p> <p>Critics, however, raise several concerns. First, job displacement. As AI takes over tasks once handled by humans, there’s growing fear of job loss, causing stress among workers. Second, lack of human touch. Despite its capabilities, AI cannot replicate the empathy, emotional intelligence, and connection offered by human leaders—essential in many roles. Third, ethical and privacy issues. Concerns about data use require clear policies to ensure fairness, transparency, and respect for privacy, maintaining employee trust.</p> <p>Conclusion: AI should be used in the workplace, but with proper regulations to maximize benefits and minimize risks. A cautious, well- planned approach is essential for the future</p> <p><img alt=\"\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://pusmendik.kemdikbud.go.id/tka/cbt_images/63716_7f4857114f8f48821c5bcac58c3214c1.png\" width=\"425\"/></p> <p>Paragraph two mainly discussed AI as…</p>",

More and more people, especially young ones, prefer using<br/>digital payment methods like e-wallets, mobile banking, and<br/>contactless cards. This new trend has given rise to what many call the<br/>“cashless generation.”<br/>One main reason for this shift is convenience. Paying with a phone or<br/>card is faster and easier than carrying coins and bills. People can now<br/>buy food, shop online, or even pay for public transport with just a tap.<br/>It also helps reduce the risk of theft since there is no physical money<br/>to lose.<br/>Another reason is the growth of technology. With smartphones<br/>becoming common and the internet being more available, digital<br/>payments have become part of daily life. Many schools and cafes now<br/>even refuse to accept cash, encouraging young people to adapt to this<br/>modern lifestyle.<br/>However, there are some concerns. Some people argue that going<br/>cashless can exclude older generations or those who do not have<br/>access to smartphones or bank accounts. Others worry about privacy<br/>and security, as digital payments can be tracked and hacked.<br/>Despite these issues, the cashless trend continues to grow.<br/>Governments and businesses are working to make digital payments<br/>more secure and more available to everyone. It seems likely that the<br/>future will be even more digital.<br/>In conclusion, the cashless generation represents a big change in how<br/>we handle money. While there are both advantages and<br/>disadvantages, it is clear that cashless payments offer many benefits<br/>in terms of speed and convenience. As long as we ensure that everyone<br/>can join this movement, the cashless future could be a smart and<br/>inclusive one.</p> <p>How does the writer present different viewpoints about the topic</p>",
